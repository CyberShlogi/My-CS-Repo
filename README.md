# About Me
My name is Letlhogonolo Phatshwane and I am a Cyber Security student. I am studying Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, an 8 Course certificate program. I chose this course after I saw a couple of good reviews from industry experts and it came in highly recommended as a good course to help prepare for the CompTIA Security+ exam, an industry leading certification for Cybersecurity roles.
