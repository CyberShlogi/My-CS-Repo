Documenting my Cyber Security learning journey and updating in real time
# About Me
My name is Letlhogonolo Phatshwane and I am a Cyber Security student. I am studying Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, an 8 Course certificate program. I chose this course after I saw a couple of good reviews from industry experts and it came in highly recommended as a good course to help prepare for the CompTIA Security+ exam, an industry leading certification for Cybersecurity roles.
# Soft Skills
In a world where everyone has all the technical skills or working towards polishing these, I believe that having soft skills is very important. Rembering and bringing in the human element, authenticity and inclusivity as well as a sense of compassion paired with effective communication is top of the list of my soft skills set. We learn a lot of technical skills as part of the work that we do and it is important skills set to have, we should equally embrace the soft skills.
# Technical Skills
I believe that by vertue of being in the tech space, we have a lot of technical skills that form part of our day to day operations. One such important technical skill to have is being able to perfrom basic tasks and operatations with hardward. This will save time and resources as opposed to logging a call a ticket to have someone come have a look at your machine because it is freezing or slow.
